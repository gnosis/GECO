### What is your Dapp about?
We focus on onboarding non crypto-users as easy as possible into digital assets

### Why did you decide to build it?
We have built a range of wallets and dapps in the past, and have on our own body experinced how hard it is to convince normal people to use it

### How big is your user base?
We have in total had around 5.0000 unique transactions so far

### How long will you need to integrate a Gnosis Safe compatible WalletConnect integration?
We will need around a month for fully tested & audited hand-over. We have already worked on WalletConnect Module to Gnosis Safe, so we are quite familiar with the codebase and what is needed.

### Does your Dapp use message signing?
We use an ephemeral private key ðŸ”‘ â€˜linkKeyâ€™ to sign the receiverâ€™s address

### How did you hear about the GECO?

We heard about GECO through our friends at Brainbot / Mainz

Thanks for a great Dappcon!
