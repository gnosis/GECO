# Microgrant Application
_This is a guideline on how to apply for a WalletConnect microgrant_


### Dapp name
Unlock! https://unlock-protocol.com

We would want to actually integrate it on 2 apps: our dashboard which lets creator manage their locks: see "Dashboard" on https://unlock-protocol.com/ 

And our "paywall" application which lets people unlock content or features inside of applications. You can see an example on our blog https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/

### Team members

BUT we would gladly transfer (and even match) the grant for a 3rd party developer to work on this!

### What is your Dapp about?
Unlock is a protocol for memberships which lets creators lock access to content they created, software they wrote... etc.

### Why did you decide to build it?
We believe the web needs a better business model, away from attention grabing!

### How big is your user base?
We've barely launched. So probably very very small, (less than 1 hundred locks have been created).

### How long will you need to integrate a Gnosis Safe compatible WalletConnect integration?
1 month seems like a good estimate.

### Does your Dapp use message signing?
> The Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet. That means there is no single private key that can be used to sign messages. If your dapp requires message signing, please map out a high level plan on how you want to make it compatible with the Safe. We are working on contract signature support via EIP1271 and hope to be able to have it live by the beginning of Q4 on Android and iOS.

For now it does not require signing but it would probably make sense to add at some point...


### How did you hear about the GECO?
Twitter!

### Others
We are using gnosis's multi sig to deploy our smart contracts ;)
