### What is your Dapp about?
It is a user interface for dOrgâ€™s Bonding Curve for DAOs: https://github.com/dOrgTech/BC-DAO, which when fully integrated will allow DAOs and others to raise money on chain by issuing a token through a bonding curve.  The token could give the buyer dividend and/or voting rights.

### Why did you decide to build it?
We are very excited about the potential for DAOs, and believe that fundraising is a key piece of infrastructure needed for DAOs to be successful.

### How big is your user base?
The DAO we are currently building for has 400 members (addresses).  Interaction with the fundraising app is permissionless and will be open to all.  Furthermore, we are talking with other DAO communities which may be interested in utilizing our application.

### How long will you need to integrate a Gnosis Safe compatible WalletConnect integration?
We anticipate development will be complete within approximately 1 month.

### Does your Dapp use message signing?
No

### How did you hear about the GECO?
Through members of the Gnosis team.
