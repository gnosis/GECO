# COALA Research Proposal

This COALA research proposal is geared towards improving the interface and facilitating the interactions between blockchain-based systems and the legal system with a focus on creating a model law for granting legal personality to unregistered DAOs. The goal is to draft a model law that will assist governments in crafting their own laws that recognise DAOs as understood in the ecosystem (and to be defined), as having full or partial legal personality, subject to the DAO fulfilling certain criteria. Those criteria should provide protections equivalent to those underpinning traditional corporate law forms while taking account of the realities of technology enabled by DAOs. 

## BASIC ARGUMENTS FOR THE MODEL LAW
The most successful DAOs so far are those that do not interface with the legacy legal system, such as crypto-grant giving DAOs, including MolochDAO, MetacartelDAO, TrojanDAO or YangDAO. Those DAOs transact nearly exclusively on-chain, and thus function well without participating in the legal system - however, potential future liabilities for these DAOs are another question. DAOs without a legal wrapper lack legal personality, which means that they can usually not create enforceable legacy system contracts, sue or be sued, or otherwise interface with the legal system. Consequently, legal redress against a DAO can be sought from its individual members, enablers or collaborateurs for all liabilities and unintended consequences flowing from the DAO, regardless of the nature of one’s participation. DAOs without a legacy corporate form wrapper can only imperfectly limit the liability of its participants by contract. To our legacy legal systems, a DAO is a nonperson that is visible only through those constituting parts that are legal persons, e.g. the humans or legal entities participating in the DAO. To make matters worse, in major jurisdictions, they may be characterised as general partnerships or unincorporated associations, in which each participant becomes jointly and severally liable for the DAO’s actions. 
DAOs as a form of organisation are unlikely to be adopted outside niche crypto communities unless members can be offered limited liability equivalent to limited liability corporate structures. 


## EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS
Proposed legacy systems solutions
To address DAO’s lack of legal personhood, solutions that use current legal frameworks as legal wrappers for DAOs have been proposed, including housing DAOs in LLCs or cooperative/mutual structures.  Proposals to house DAOs in LLCs in the United States has garnered special ecosystem attention, particularly as a blockchain-based limited liability companies under the Vermont Limited Liability Company Act. Limited liability, far reaching and extremely flexible freedom of contract as well as favourable tax treatment (enabling pass-through tax) are good reasons to consider US law LLCs as candidates for DAO wrappers. Moreover, various US states, among them Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado,, Delaware, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont (see below), Washington, Wyoming, have passed blockchain specific regulation, several of which deal with recognising signatures and records obtained through blockchain technology as electronic signatures and records. Points to consider against incorporating as an LLC are the closeness to the U.S. regulators deriving from incorporation in the US, the prohibition to admit members from nation states subject to U.S. sanctions, the uncertainty as to the regulatory plans of the U.S. federal government, and the arguable requirement to identify all members of an LLC DAO.

### Code-controlled zero-member US LLCs 
A more radical solution has been proposed by legal scholar Shawn Bayern that, prima facie, deals with the shortcomings of requiring a board or members for an entity housing a DAO, who have more extensive exposure to the legal system than other participants in the DAO. 
In relation to autonomous systems generally, Bayern has suggested that this may be achieved as follows: legal persons set up an LLC filing necessary paperwork with a limited number of members and that LLC is managed by members. Those members then agree on an operating agreement subjecting the LLC to the control of the autonomous system. The members transfers ownership of any necessary hardware for the autonomous system to the LLC. The members then all withdraw, leaving a memberless LLC controlled by the autonomous system. The result is that the autonomous system has been bestowed with a functional analogue to legal personhood. 

The proposed technique takes advantage of the flexible LLC regime instituted by several US states. It also relies on the power of contract law; i.e. “that an agreement may give legal significance to the action of any process or system, without regard to the legal personhood of that process or system, by specifying appropriate terms, promises, and conditions.” 

The idea that LLCs may be memberless and be able to house autonomous entities without any person being in control has been severely criticised by scholars and remains untested. As such, Scherer shows that Bayern cherry-picked statutory provisions without regard to provisions that do not support or in fact negate Bayern’s interpretation. 

Among other things, Scherer has pointed out that under the statutes cited by Bayern a memberless LLC automatically dissolves after a set period of time, and a dissolved LLC loses its legal personhood, including its ability to sue or be sued. Any person who deals with such an entity would be unable to seek legal redress from that memberless entity - a result not intended by the legislature and unlikely to be upheld by a court beyond the 90-day cure period. Scherer highlights that the referenced legislation presume at least one owner, shareholder or member that are legal persons of the LLC.

Scherer further maintains that it is unlikely that a court would conclude that any of the referenced legislation allowed a zero-member LLC to exist under the control of an autonomous system beyond the short-lived cure period. Allowing for zero-member LLCs controlled by an autonomous system is unlikely to fulfil the legislative intent behind the statutes cited by Bayern. As Bayern himself admits, his private law construct does not deal with administrative or criminal law considerations of autonomous systems. 

Thus, at this stage, the member-less LLC governed by code-based operating agreement is a proposition resting in theory rather than practice, with potential drawbacks enumerated below. 

Other legacy system structures that have been proposed are (1) the Swiss Verein Structure, (2) Cooperative/Mutuals, (3) Dutch Foundations, (4) Common Law Business Trusts as well as limited liability companies in other jurisdictions including France, Germany and England and Wales. 

## NECESSITY OF LEGAL REFORM 
Though Bayern’s LLC wrapper may deal with the lack of DAO personhood in the short term, we do not consider that it provides a long-term solution. Legal reform accommodating the realities of DAOs and similar systems is necessary to unlock the full potential of DAOs. 

Malta is the first jurisdiction worldwide that has passed a law, the Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services Act (“ITAS”) which explicitly mentions DAOs as a form of an ‘Innovative Technological Arrangements’ (“ITA”), and their registration within an ITA register. ITAS establishes a system for the recognition (i.e. the certification) for ITAs. A fourth law is eagerly awaited that is expected to bestow legal personhood on certain registered ITA. It is also to amend the shortcomings of ITAS. ITAS is technologically neutral and sets out the requirements for registration of ITAs. It can be characterised by its focus on establishing intermediaries as gatekeepers/agents, namely: 
applicant (innovative technology authorisation holder, e.g. developer, designer)
resident agent (an ITA service provider)
technical administrator (in office at all times)
system auditor
sometimes curator (appointed by court to act as resident agent)

ITAS falls short for the following reasons:
* Rigid requirements: Technical Administrators must have backdoor access to all smart contracts to maintain the ability to vary technology were required by law/regs;
* Applicant/Holder of certification is bound to fulfil all the reg conditions for as long as the recognition remains in force.
* High costs diminishing the chance for a start-up to develop a financially sustainable business model
* Any change in smart contract/participation rights need to be notified and reviewed and approved by regulator
* No explicit mentioning that there is limited liability after recognition
* No clear determination of likely liabilities of applicant, developers or owners 

Legal reform is necessary, unavoidable and potentially desirable because:

* People can already technically transact with DAOs, even if they have no legal personality. We need to enable the legal system to perceive these transactions as legal transactions. If nothing is done, the law will treat DAOs as general partnerships, leading to possible liability for all members.
* “Nearest available person” principle cannot be easily applied in the case of DAOs because the creator might be anonymous (E.g. Bitcoin), or might have gone extinct (e.g. company bankruptcy)
* Need for developer protection: developers shall not be considered liable for unforeseeable damages caused by a DAO (cf. issue with fiduciary obligations: devs should not be held responsible for their code - unless malicious)
* Need for consumer protection, even if there is no party to which recourse can be claimed, e.g. via a system of insurance to cover potential risks or damages to the consumers 
* Assets of a DAO cannot be seized, insurance policy makes it possible to cover damages to consumers
* Incentivize the creation of “legally compliant” DAOs, if want to benefit from the advantages of legal personality
* Need for a point of contact: Enable a DAO to be anchored into one (or more) jurisdictions + provide point of contact (via a legal “Avatar”?)
* Building ecosystem with third parties: facilitate contractual relationships with third party services (e.g. Oracles) as enforceable contracts under the law
* Taxation: make it possible for a government to tax DAOs under certain circumstances


## Issues to be considered:
Transnational nature of DAOs, problem of international recognition?
Do we need formal registration (e.g. Malta’s law?) or automatic recognition if criteria are met?
Should human collaborateurs/enablers be necessary? If so, how many and how can those be kept to a minimum?
Shall different types of “legal persons” exist whose right would depend on the provided technical guarantees?
What happens in the case of a fork? What procedures to follow? Do we need special rules if physical assets or facilities are involved?
Should the law be technologically neutral? This is the case for Malta’s ITA Law, but caused it to turn any DAO into a legacy system company (with all its shortcomings).

## Scope of Work
We anticipate undertaking and completion of this project will comprise at least six months (Nov 2019-April 2020) and require the participation and contribution of key experts across a variety of domains and jurisdictions with requisite legal background, technical knowledge, and creativity to implement a sound and holistic social and technical vision, within the legal, economic and cultural constraints of the physical world.  

The entire project will require (1) legal research from experts based in relevant legal jurisdictions and (2) technical research to inform the design of the Model Law.  Milestones and deliverables have been listed below. The project will retain 1 full-time researcher and 1 part-time coordinator, working with a diverse qualified body of external experts, lawyers and researchers on a continuous basis. 

We also anticipate that such initial research will require expert review and feedback in the form of in-person workshops to enable cross-pollination across diverse areas of legal research and  technical design. We anticipate that at least 2 workshops will be required at a minimum during the six-month project term. Based on the results, feedback and iteration of the research and design process during the first three months, the remaining three months of the project will be focused on the formal specification and design implementation.

## Use of funds:
Research track: 1 full-time person working for the duration of the project (six months) to collect all emergent information on an ongoing basis regarding the regulatory frameworks and relevant technical innovations regarding the grant of full or partial legal personality to DAOs in the selected jurisdictions and cataloguing all relevant legal reforms and statements issued by oversight and regulatory authorities around the world.

### Coordination track: 
We will hire one part-time coordinator working for the duration of the project (six months) to coordinate the work of multiple experts around the various attributes of the DAO Model Law.

### Workshops: 
We will organize two workshops with the COALA community comprising relevant legal, technical and subject-matter experts in order to elaborate the details of the proposal DAO Model Law.
