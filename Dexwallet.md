### What project are you building

The goal of DexWallet is to empower millions to have financial freedom via DeFi. We do that by providing cutting-edge technology to make DeFi opportunities accessibles to anyone.

The number one problem with decentralized applications is UX. Dexwallet streamlined user experience is designed for both power and novice users. We build interfaces that provide clarity, reduce complexity and provide users with tools to make sophisticated operations seamless.

What makes Dexwallet unique is the understanding that interoperability between DeFi protocols generates a compounding effect to maximize the financial value that wouldn’t be otherwise accessible by a single protocol.

### Project description

**Gnosis Safe Contracts integration**

The more users are interacting with a variety of smart contracts, building articulated strategies to earning from their assets, the more they will need to combine a variety of operations to make it happen.

We call this variety of operations “recipes” and it’s our plan to automate them in order to let our customers extract maximum possible value from DeFi protocols, without having to move their assets across multiple platforms and devices to rebalance the investment.
