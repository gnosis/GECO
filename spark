What project are you building
We are building an NFT/IDO “Prediction Pad”. The key feature at the very core of the Totem Spark platform is the fair and transparent access it provides to the most promising upcoming IDOs and NFT drops for the crypto community. 

The key USPs of Totem Spark is the gamification which will be prevalent throughout the platform; unlike other capital allocation platforms on the market, which exist only to sell pre-IDO tokens, allocations and NFTs in Totem Spark’s partner projects will be granted to users based on how accurately they can predict certain elements of the launch. From price to token holders there are a number of categories to focus on which will be explored as the platform expands. 

Preliminary off-chain prediction events to determine product market fit, have initially focused on token price 24 hours after the token lists on its chosen DEX/CEX. There is scope to expand prediction variables which will be incorporated further along the roadmap. The direction and order of these developments will be decided upon through community consensus, via the platform’s on chain governance. 


Why did you decide to build it
There are four MAIN problems we see with traditional IDO’s and IDO launchpads. We decided to build our product to solve these problems. Below is a list of these problems and how we aim to address them:

1. Transparency
The problem: 
Third party trust is required for the whitelisting selection process.
Our solution: 
All prediction events will be on the blockchain and therefore, trustless. So it will be plain to see for all. 
2. Accessibility
The problem: 
Early fundraising rounds are offered only to exclusive investment groups or demographics.

Our solution: 
The equitable provision of high quality projects to community members simply and efficiently. Anyone can use our predictor, and therefore people from ALL demographics and investment classes will have a chance to participate in a fair market.

3. Efficiency
The problem: 
Methods like First Come First Serve drive unnecessary wastage on gas fees, which falls unfairly on the user.
Our solution: 
No false starts; algorithmically allocated rewards eliminate gas fee wastage.

4. Interactivity
The problem: 
Current whitelisting solutions are arduous and uninteresting.
Our solution: 
Gamified prediction-based entries drive community excitement and uptake in the project.



How long will it take
Our product will be finalized in the next four to six months and should be live in Q2 of 2022.
How much funding are you requesting
$5K - $100K
How did you hear about the GECO
I came across the GECO on this website https://web3grants.org/ , however our CEO (Jolyon) has told me to read up on Gnosis as he is a big fan.

Project description
Description:
Totem Spark is a decentralised platform which aims to fuse creators and investors together in a seamless, exciting and transparent way. The goal is to expand on current capital allocation platforms by adding gamification, additional reward features, variety of creation prizes and more. 
Key elements required to generate the spark will be through designing and implementing a roadmap which delivers high value added to all stakeholders involved, whether that is the creators, community members, adjacent projects and indeed wider blockchain ecosystem participants. It is a collaborative space and therefore we want this to be at the forefront of what the platform hopes to achieve, win-win situations. 
Creators come in many different varieties and are essential to the expansion and innovation in the ecosystem. Whether it’s an innovative solution, platform, NFT, or otherwise our vision is to create a protocol that provides starting blocks to jump into the world whilst generating sufficient momentum via engaged communities to continue their progress.
Cryptosphere participants have been through a lot, they are constantly fighting high gas fees, simulated bots, unfair capital allocation, and lack of information. Spark’s platform will be their shining light, with a variety of solutions to promote equity and excitement for participation.
Why we are building it:
‘Coming to market’ is a frequently travelled route which is always rapidly evolving, especially in the fast moving nature of the blockchain industry. In the past few years there have been some fantastic innovations and the Spark platform is looking to bring a variety of solutions which have the aim of improving the experience for all stakeholders involved.
2.1	Incumbent problems:
Lack of transparency -  Lottery based methods lack transparency as the trust is in the third party creating the whitelisting solution to do it in a fair manner
 
Real-Access - Early fundraising rounds, Rare NFT drops are often designed in a way to benefit a select few, usually wealthy, parties leaving normal market participants disadvantaged 
 
Inefficiency - Methods like first come first serve drive unnecessary wastage and gas fees, which ultimately fall unfairly on the user and does not promote equal opportunity for real users over bots
 
Interactivity - Current whitelisting solutions can be arduous and uninteresting however the prediction based entry drives excitement and uptake 
 
2.2	Spark solutions:
Lack of transparency - Spark blockchain-based predictions will be visible on the public ledger and therefore have fully transparency meaning no reliance on third part integrity will be needed
 
Real-Access - To drive equality, Totem Spark will look to deliver opportunities to be part of high quality projects and NFT auctions alongside industry leading investors
Inefficiency - False starts are not in the interest of the Sparks project. Methods like first come first serve drive unnecessary wastage and gas fees, which ultimately fall unfairly on the user and does not promote a equitable investing platform for real users over bots
 
Interactivity -Adding a gamification element with prediction-based entries drives excitement in the community and uptake in the project
 
The overall goal and future outlook of our project:
Our overall goal is to become the industry leader in bringing accessibility and reputability to IDO’s in crypto. Currently, the IDO landscape is rife with scams and dangers. There are a handful of exclusive people who benefit from these launches while the majority of people lose their money in unfair launches.
This creates a volatile situation which deters the mass adoption of crypto and the reputation of the crypto industry to the mainstream population.
We will help create a safe environment for IDO’s that will be fair and give all people, especially retail investors an equal opportunity to participate in new launches. This will help drive mass adoption to crypto. Furthermore, we will also incorporate predictions on NFTs which will help bridge the gap between the NFT space and the DeFi space. There are a lot of mainstream individuals who only dabble in NFTs, our project will help give these people exposure to more elements of crypto and, again, help drive mass adoption by providing a safe solution for investors of all classes to participate in
The future outlook of our project is a highly scalable industry driver of project launches in crypto. We will also be incorporating yield farming, data analytics & community sentiment reporting and a derivatives platform.
 
You should fund us because:
We are making the crypto industry a safer and more trustworthy space by creating a platform that will help retail investors participate in IDO’s in a risk free manner which safeguards them from scams, bot attacks and getting rekt
We are making IDO’s accessible to investors of all classes and not just an exclusive few
We are driving mass-adoption of crypto by fixing the reputation currently associated with IDO’s and ICO’s by creating the go-to platform for trustworthy project launches
We are offering one-of-a-kind NFT prediction markets whereby investors could win NFT allocations with correct predictions
We are bridging the gap between the vanilla NFT space (where a lot of people are exposed to crypto without actually being involved in any other facet of crypto) and the DeFi space. This will help drive more interest from NFT only investors to other facets of crypto as we are providing them with a soft entry.
 
Features
3.1	Firing up access to in-demand markets
The key feature at the very core of the Totem Spark platform is the fair and transparent access it provides to the most promising upcoming IDOs and NFT drops for the crypto community. 
 
The key USPs of Totem Spark is the gamification which will be prevalent throughout the platform; unlike other capital allocation platforms on the market, which exist only to sell pre-IDO tokens, allocations and NFTs in Totem Spark’s partner projects will be granted to users based on how accurately they can predict certain elements of the launch. From price to token holders there are a number of categories to focus on which will be explored as the platform expands. 
 
Preliminary off-chain prediction events to determine product market fit, have initially focused on token price 24 hours after the token lists on its chosen DEX/CEX. There is scope to expand prediction variables which will be incorporated further along the roadmap. The direction and order of these developments will be decided upon through community consensus, via the platform’s on chain governance. 
 
3.2	Tiers
Totem Spark is designed with user incentivisation in mind, empowering holders of $SPARX tokens to capitalize upon and support new creations coming to life on the platform. Through our three tier system shown below, Totem Spark participants are awarded project allocations - based on the accuracy in their predictions, of course -  based on the quantity of Spark tokens they own.

3.3	Due Diligence Flow
Creator Application and Due Diligence Process
Spark is a FUBU (For You By You) platform, we have a fine tuned focus on both the community and creators. We understand that no founder's route to igniting 'the spark' is the same, the project and community are here to give our full support to every artist, founder, and creator that goes through our platform. We strive to connect our community with the best creations, and who better than the community themselves to vet and vote on which projects they want to see come through the platform. 
 
The platform and Spark community will be specifically looking for projects with innovative industry leading ideas and solutions with the expertise and flair to execute. There will be a set of principles and values that we token holders believe are key for a successful creation and will work to this thesis, it will be reviewed over time to maintain relevance in an ever changing industry.
 

 
Protection for the community is of paramount important, and as such, each set of creators will be subject to a thorough a community centric due diligence process which will be a 6 part flow:

 
3.4	Platform participants’ benefits
As well as gaining market access to some of the most prominent, promising and exciting upcoming token launches and IDOs, users of the Totem Spark platform will enjoy a host of additional benefits. These include:
 
Getting in on the ground floor: Totem Spark users will not only get access to the projects on offer through the platform, but will enjoy the lucrative benefits of accessing the best presale price rounds of these projects, without the associated minimum threshold reserved for investment funds.
 
Peace of mind: given the lengthy research and due diligence processes the Totem Spark team will subject projects to ahead of offering them on the platform, users can be assured that they’re investing into high quality, vetted projects with strong fundamental value
Community: Beyond the commercial incentives to participate in the Totem Spark project, there are also numerous “soft” benefits, including being a part of up-and-coming, welcoming and inclusive crypto communities.
 
 
Level playing field: with the use of the prediction sorting algorithm elimination of First Come First Serve, whitelist sign up sheets bots will put the power back in the hands of real users.
 
Three-fold rewards: In addition to gaining an allocation or NFT, users will also be obtaining high yield staking rewards on entry to the prediction event. Their final position will also entitle them to a lump sum amount of $SPRK tokens for their accuracy on predictions.
 
3.5	Partner Projects’ Benefits
As well as conferring benefits onto the users of the platform, Totem Spark also provides numerous benefits and incentives to the projects and artists we’ll be partnering with, whose pre-IDO tokens and NFTs we’ll be offering to our users. These include:  
Prestigious promotion: Totem Spark offers a great exposure with an extremely active, engaged and vocal audiences in the cryptosphere. Partner projects would also be working alongside some of the most prominent players within the space, and by signing up to the Totem Spark platform would be adding their names to an impressive roster of high-profile projects.
 
Network access; By partnering with Totem Spark, projects would acquire access to some of the most knowledgeable and influential market participants within the space, as well as the most successful investment funds. 
 
Community; Totem Spark, through its association with the well established, well reputed and widely known TotemFi brand, gives projects access to a ready-made community of real investors, supporters and project participants. 
 
Capital; A fundamental reason for projects to participate in the Totem Spark initiative is the capital which it provides; Totem Spark has a broad user base of investors very keen to engage with and invest in exciting and promising projects. This has the additional benefit of dispersing tokens among a wider network of token holders than by allocating them to a single fund, investor or entity.
3.6	Platform flow
A primary goal is to allow token holders and creators to interact effortlessly with the platform in a way that optimises the user journey. For individuals predicting on the platform this focuses on secure predictions with clear NFT and project overview information, and automatic yield features. For creators it will be a seamless listing and prediction event allowing transparent distribution of their NFTs or tokens to the highly engaged community of investors.
