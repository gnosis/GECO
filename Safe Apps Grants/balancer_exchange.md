## Project Overview

### Project name

Balancer Exchange Safe App

### Team members

- @TomAFrench (`Tom French#3331` on Discord)

### What project are you building

I'm building a simple interface to use the Balancer DEX to trade tokens. This _doesn't_ allow provision of liquidity and so is not relevant to the advertised $6000 bounty.

Users should be able to simply trade tokens in such a way similar to the experience they get at [balancer.exchange](https://balancer.exchange)

### Why did you decide to build it

I chose to build this as there is currently only one option (1inch) for DEX trading using a Gnosis Safe and I believe that the ecosystem would be best served by a wide range of options.

Gnosis and Balancer Labs have also partnered on a bounty for an app for pool liquidity provision and this dovetails with a trading app which is more "end user" focussed

### How long will it take

Work started last Friday (10th July). I have a working prototype but it should take a few days from now for a round or two of UI feedback + changes before it's ready 

### How much funding are you requesting

\$1,500 since it's a project of medium complexity.

### How did you hear about the GECO

I've previously created two Safe Apps.
