## Project Overview

### Project name

yearn.finance Safe App

### Team members

- @TomAFrench (`Tom French#3331` on Discord)

### What project are you building

I'm building a simple interface to deposit/withdraw funds from yearn.finance vaults. Essentially https://yearn.finance/vaults in the Gnosis style.

### Why did you decide to build it

Eric Conner reached out and asked if I was interested.

### How long will it take

The app is pretty much done. I'm in the process of testing but what with it being YFI the options are "I test in prod" or simulate using Tenderly so I'm opting for the latter.

### How much funding are you requesting

\$3000 as discussed with Eric.

### How did you hear about the GECO

I've previously created three Safe Apps.
