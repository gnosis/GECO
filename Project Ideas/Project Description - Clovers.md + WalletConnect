### What is your Dapp about?
Clovers Network is a proof-of-search collectible game.

### Why did you decide to build it?
Clovers Network utilizes some of the most interesting aspects of the blockchain space and gently introduces the concepts through a fun and interactive game.

### How big is your user base?
We've have 367 on-chain users create over 25,000 transactions in our first week on mainnet.

### How long will you need to integrate a Gnosis Safe compatible WalletConnect integration?
Wallet Connect is already integrated into our app. We would just need Gnosis Safe to support EIP1271 for message signing login.

### Does your Dapp use message signing?
Yes, we need Gnosis to support EIP1271 although we're also interested in exploring support for a contract based wallet by checking signatures against the `isOwner` function of the `OwnerManager.sol` contract.
