## Project Overview

### Project name
Parcel 

### Team members
[Tarun Gupta](https://github.com/tarun1475) & [Anubhav Girdhar](https://github.com/anubhavgirdhar)  

### What project are you building
Parcel is an open source web3 native crypto payroll and treasury management on top of Gnosis Safe with built-in end-to-end data encryption using IPFS & Filecoin.

### Why did you decide to build it
Having worked with Biconomy for over a year and receiving our salaries in stablecoins, We realised the current process of paying crypto salaries is highly time consuming, expensive and error prone. 

We talked to the Biconomy team and took various user interviews regarding the same problem and decided to build the first iteration of Parcel at Hack money and iterated more at HackFS Hackathon. 

After validating this idea from Hackathon judges/mentors and various people at Gitcoin Kernel Genesis Block, we decided to build Parcel.

### How long will it take
6-8 weeks

### How much funding are you requesting
3K USD 


### How did you hear about the GECO 
Github 


### Project description
Parcel will enable organizations to seamlessly run crypto payroll (with multiple tokens) through mass payouts and/or money streaming in one single transaction (via transaction batching) with the help of gnosis multisig account.

It ensures end-to-end encryption for organization data on IPFS and Filecoin and the encryption key is calculated deterministically through signatures using an Ethereum private key.  

Moreover, Parcel is built to empower people to receive payments in real-time and employers to run crypto payroll and manage treasury without any hassle.

### Why should We fund You?
Parcel is the open source and trustless bridge for companies/teams to manage their treasury using defi money legos & run payroll from Gnosis Safe thereby bringing more adoption to the Gnosis ecosystem. 

### Features
1) 1 click mass payouts.
2) Employee onboarding and store E2EE data on top of IPFS & Filecoin. 
3) Seamless accounting using easy to export transactions history and integration with quickbooks. 
4) Earn Interest using AAVE and employers can offer delegated credit lines to their employees. 


### Tech Stack
1) Gnosis Safe for multisig accounts.
2) Sablier Protocol for money streaming.
3) Uniswap for token swapping
4) IPFS for encrypted data storage.
5) Textile's Powegate for encrypted data archiving on Filecoin.
6) Ethereum signature for generating encryption keys deterministically.
7) Metamask, wallet connect, wallet link for wallet management.
8) Matic Network for onchain optimization and scalability of E2EE business logic.
9) Biconomy for network agnostic Meta Transactions i.e without changing layer1 rpc provider on Metamask.
