# THIRM

### Project Name
THIRM
### Project Overview
THIRM achieves financial assurance by distributing your capital across various trusted cryptocurrencies and simultaneously grows your capital through compounded interest.
The THIRM Ecosystem has 3 elements in it:
  - THIRM PROTOCOL --
     An underlying protocol that governs and operates asset diversification and
binding, various contracts, and underlined logic.
  - THIRM TOKEN --
   A Store Of Value ERC20 TOKEN that is backed by various cryptocurrencies
assets.

  - T-TOKENS --
  Collocation of Tokens that brings Non-ERC20 based cryptocurrencies onto the
Ethereum Network, Each T-Token is backed 1:1 By original that cryptocurrency.


### What project are you building

THIRM is an ecosystem which is backed by various cryptocurrencies altogether, with a failsafe system that removes non-performing assets and adds new promising projects. THIRM PROTOCOL is open source, and it doesn't require you to access/manage various assets, you will directly interact with THIRM PROTOCOL to invest /divest anytime. This THIRM Ecosystem will have 3 Elements(THIRM PROTOCOL, THIRM TOKEN, and T-TOKEN ). These elements will provide a safe and secure decentralized environment with the potential of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum,litecoin, and more to the ERC20 network.

THIRM PROTOCOL is a system that binds various cryptocurrencies & business logic to THIRM TOKEN. This protocol is responsible for multiple actions to invest/divest wealth and be accessible to users via THIRM TOKEN INTERFERENCE. THIRM PROTOCOL will also sometimes generate money via lending assets, staking cryptocurrencies. In this case, interest will be divided among all the THIRM TOKEN holders.

Now to introduce various cryptocurrencies to the ERC20 network, the THIRM Ecosystem has T-TOKEN. Each T-TOKEN is always backed by its native cryptocurrency and can easily be minted and burned based on requirements.

THIRM TOKEN is an ERC20 based token which is backed by multiple cryptocurrencies. When you hold THIRM TOKEN in theory, you are carrying all assets, and when you send/receive THIRM TOKEN, you are transferring all your collative wealth without paying hefty fees for each coin transfer.

A smart contract allows you to Cashin/Cashout THIRM at any time, unlocks many arbitrage benefits for traders, at the same time, provides a stable crypto performance index to benchmark other crypto performances.

### Why did you decide to build it

Several cases been noted where users lost the majority of their wealth investing in a single asset, also a lot of fake coins, ICOs, pumps, and dumps fool unsophisticated investors into losing funds. To minimize the user's risk and headache of manning multiple investments, we created an ecosystem that will provide a decentralized environment with the power of investing in numerous ERC20/Non-ERC20 Cryptocurrencies by using just a single Token. Our ecosystem also works as an index benchmark, a reliable, stable pair against other cryptocurrencies.

### How much funding are you requesting
50,000 USD (refundable after liquidity bootup) + 8,000 USD for legal/research/development + 3 months of office space in fullnode berlin [for 2] (if possible)

Total : 58,000 $

### How did you hear about the GECO
From google(browsing), also using genosis in BETA of our project, and after that were contacted by your team(discord).

### How long will it take
Between 8 to 10 weeks. The devlopment of THIRM has already been progress from last few months. 


### Your Proposal
---
#### Project description
We are using these funds to create a pool of our ecosystem (which will have T-TOKEN, THIRM TOKEN, and THIRM PROTOCOL) and cover our research and development costs. The plan is to launch our product to the general public after using these funds and to Introduce Trustworthy cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum environment.

#### Project Features

  - Market Index: 
  THIRM binds many cryptocurrencies together ( Doesn't matter the codebase), gives a stable market index, attracts users to invest/divest into various cryptocurrencies with one simple TOKEN.

  - Governance:
  Decentralized governance to allow users to participate and influence THIRM ECOSYSTEM DECISIONS. A decentralized voting system allows everyone to input your feedback/suggestions for adding removing new coins & other valuable feedback.
  
  - Open & Easy Trade:
  THIRM TOKEN can be traded on any DEX ( Decentralized Exchange) or Centralised Exchange, purely your choice.

  - ERC20 Standardization: 
  Instead of complicated chainlinks, THIRM ECOSYSTEM uses T-TOKENS to bring native cryptocurrencies onto ERC20 Environment, we tokenized all major non ERC20 cryptocurrencies, which can be directly traded DEX.

   - Interest/Staking: 
  THIRM PROTOCOL will generate profits by staking and lending cryptocurrencies, and the profit will be auto distributed among all the THIRM TOKENS holders.
  - Wealth Diversification:
  To spread the capital across various trusted cryptocurrencies for the means of stability.
  -  Secure Investments:
  To introduce easy investments to crypto space, users can invest in whole crypto space with one easy-to-use protocol.
  - Reduce Complexity:
  to reduce complexity and adoption curve for users in the crypto space by providing easy to use/manage a single contract.
  - Wealth Growth:
  To grow the valuation by investing in most trusted cryptocurrencies, enjoy the peace of knowing that you own the best companies in the crypto space.

  - Collateral For Crypto Loans:
Giving & Taking loans in crypto space is a complete nightmare due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, We will overcome this as our THIR TOKEN is backed by multiple cryptocurrencies which makes it as the perfect collateral in the crypto space.
  - No Individual Fees:
  THIRM is a collective token. When you transfer THIRM, you move all proportion of cryptocurrencies it holds, without paying fees on native blockchains of respected blockchain. Transferring value is much more comfortable in THIRM then sending all those cryptocurrencies together. 

#### Team description
Our team is consists of 2 Members.
 - Aman Singh is the Founder, with 11+ years of experience in web development, and also he is an experienced data scientist. He has built a lot of websites, bots, scripts, and a lot of his work accounts for mission-critical systems previously.

 - Yashaswi Co-Founder is the managing head of business and communication, a parttime developer.

#### Timeline, Milestones and Deliverables
|Phases | Discription |  Period  |  Amount |

### Others
We would like to share that, 

#### Our business model prefers us to be under a parent organization, and in the past few months, we have been experimenting with gnosis protocol and uniswap protocol. The Gnosis's order matching and limit orders is a good option for our project. We prefer to develop on that, and so we would like to join you as a child organization.
