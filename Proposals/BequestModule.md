## Your Proposal 
### Project description
https://github.com/gnosis/safe-modules/pull/23

**Bequest Module** - Allows to bequest all funds on the wallet to be withdrawn after a given time. Moreover, after the given time the heir can execute any transaction on the inherited wallet.

Also it adds wrappers to easily bequest all ERC-20 and ERC-1155 tokens available in a wallet instead of bequesting the wallet itself.

The bequest date and heir can be changed at any time.

Please fund me for having done this work, despite I did not do this proposal before starting the work, because otherwise would be dishonest and because I want to keep working for Gnosis project.

This project is to be able to finance charities by non-donors and other persons who wish to bequest. It also can be used for such things as a parental bequest.

### Others	 
It is a very innovative way to bequest.

Need also create UI (outside of the proposal scope).

Need also create a mean to split bequest between several heirs (outside of the proposal scope).

Need also create a ERC-721 bequests (outside of the proposal scope).
