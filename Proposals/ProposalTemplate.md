## Your Proposal 
### Project description
Shamba Dynamic aims to become a premier provider of agricultural data for smart contracts and the DeFi ecosystem. Our goal is to make available high quality data on the weather, crops and the natural environment. Most of this data is off-chain and is typically in geospatial format, an area where we are specialized in. Within the larger DeFi ecosystem, we come in as a data oracle focused on providing data related to agriculture and the natural environment. Many of these datasets hold the potential to lead to innovations in the field of DeFi applications once they are made available to developers. 
Shamba Dynamic is coming in at the data layer, where our role is to make available geospatial data produced by different organizations and experts, to various blockchain platforms. To do this we shall be running oracle nodes as part of a decentralized oracle network such as Chainlink. Our aim is to become a premier global supplier of agricultural and natural environment data for all kinds of smart contracts.
Our project is underpinned by building a data economy through partnerships with various parties. On the data sourcing end, we will build partnerships with a wide array of data producers, ensuring alignment to core values of data accuracy and reliability. On the data consumption end, we will build partnerships with smart contract developers with a view of understanding the type of data they need so we can supply it.
The key problem we hope to address is the lack of quality data options for agriculture related solutions in decentralized finance. The status quo has only a few data providers and limited options in the quality and variety of data available to dapp developers. We believe this limitation restricts innovation in the nascent DeFi industry and this is particularly serious for agriculture related solutions. 
Our work will empower the wider DeFi ecosystem by availing specialized geospatial data to power new solutions. We expect our service to directly benefit decentralized oracles such as Chainlink by increasing the number of data feed oracles they offer, dapp developers on platforms such as Etherisc who will get new data to build new products, as well as off-chain data producers who will get a solution to getting their data on-chain. Indirectly we expect to benefit millions of farmers who will get access to new risk management products courtesy of our contribution to the DeFi ecosystem. 

### Features
We will be implementing our solution on the Ethereum platform, creating data oracles on  Chainlink, and serving dapps developed for platforms such as Etherisc, Vulcan and Gnosis.
In particular we want to provide data that drive smart contracts dealing with prediction markets in agriculture. Other areas are crop insurance and derivatives.
### Team description
Kennedy Nganga – Founder and CEO
Kennedy has an engineering background and has worked as a researcher, analyst and developer for over 8 years. His domain has historically been in agriculture where he has worked across a dozen countries in Africa, using geospatial information to empower smallholder farmers. He has worked with several multinational firms including CIAT-CGIAR. He has a long running interest in blockchain technologies and is particularly passionate about DeFi and how it can be applied to agriculture. 
Samuel Wanjohi - CTO
Samuel is a full stack web developer specializing in geospatial technology. He has held several leadership roles in software development projects for high profile organizations across Africa. He is also well versed in blockchain-based solutions and has helped organizations in implementation projects.
Steve Firsake - Senior GIS Developer
Steve is a senior software developer specializing in developing geospatial information systems and mobile applications. He has worked with various multinational research centers on high profile Earth observation projects including the NASA-backed SERVIR project. 
Hezron Seya – Senior Geospatial Analyst
Hezron is a geospatial data wizard, specializing in extracting valuable insights from big data. He has worked with a number of organizations in the geospatial space in Kenya, including WRA which is the agency mandated to manage water resources across Kenya. He has over 8 years’ experience working with geospatial.
Mohamed Ajuang – Senior Geospatial Analyst
Mohamed is a geospatial analyst with experience working on projects from across Africa. He has worked with international private research conglomerates such as the Dalberg Research Group, producing information to inform high level decisions.
