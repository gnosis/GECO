## Project Overview

### Project name
Colony Manager
### Team members 
Raid Guild
### What project are you building 
A app to allow Gnosis Safe's to control some of the core functionality of a colony; moving funds, assigning permissions, minting tokens, triggering rewards, etc.
### Why did you decide to build it 
We use popup colonies to track work for some of our raids. Right now, this is a somewhat trustful process as individuals are permissioned directly. Allowing colonies to use a Gnosis Safe to manage their core functionality would allow us to remove much of the trust from our Colony interactions.
### How long will it take 
We estimate around two months to implement and deploy the app.
### How much funding are you requesting  
$3,000
