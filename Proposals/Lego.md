# Lego DAO


## Project Overview
### Project name
> Lego DAO
### Team members
> Jelle Gerbrandy, Ezra Weller, Oren Sokolowsky, Eric Arsenault, Eylon Aviv
### What project are you building
> We are building "Lego DAO": a framework for DAOs that combines DAO "lego blocks" into a set of reusable tools. Specifically, we are looking for funding to finish the MVP that we are building, which is built around Gnosis Safe and Compound Governance.
### Why did you decide to build it
> We believe that many newly emerging DAOs have the need for a neutral governance framework that is less opinionated than the "complete DAO" solutions from DAOstack, Aragon, or Colony, and that is more structured than the "a token, a multi-sig, and Snapshot" approach that seems the most workable approach that is currently available.  We also believe the time is right: there are currently enough DAO "lego blocks" (Gnosis Safe, Compound governor, Snapshot, Sybil, token-locking, various decision procedures, etc) available to create such a framework.
### How long will it take
> This is an open-ended project, so there is no clear final date. We believe we can build a useable MVP from the code we already have in about 3 months.
### How much funding are you requesting
> $100k - we can agree on specific deliverables
### How did you hear about the GECO
> Twitter + Auryn Macmillan

[Why Lego DAO?](https://www.notion.so/Why-Lego-DAO-aa28e06aa1a149b0a3a16cdbe0b76188) 

Gnosis has specifically expressed desire to see more DAO adoption and tooling related to Gnosis Safe. We are creating a framework in which Gnosis Safe plays an essential role, and so are extending the number of use cases for Gnosis Safe and make it a logical choice for a central component in a DAO architecture.
Also, as a team of experienced and connected DAO builders, we believe we have a high chance of successfully building on and advocating for Gnosis Safe-based solutions such as Lego. We are already in talks with a number of prominent projects including Yearn, DXdao, Rarible, and Lido.
