# Gnosis Corporate
_Corporate funtionality for Gnosis systems._

## Project Overview

_Gnosis Corporate_ is a set of tools and modules aimed at powering up Gnosis Safe with 
corporate-specific functionality such as shareholder governance, roles, separate budgets, etc.

### What are we building?

Building _Gnosis Corporate Safe_ entails the implementation of custom modules to the Gnosis Safe 
contracts. These modules will allow the management of Gnosis Safe with more complex structures than
the N-of-M multisig provided by default.

For example, in a company a majority of shareholders can vote to appoint or remove a president. The president can then spend funds up until certain limit and sign documents (data) on behalf of the company. Shareholders can also vote on the creation of new budgets with their own limits and characteristics, etc.

### Why build this?

Gnosis is a powerful tool for participating in a decentralized economy as more than just an 
individual. However, currently it lacks the necessary governance flexibility to cover the most common 
cases in the corporate world.

Gnosis modular architecture adequately allows to implement advanced governance mechanisms that make
it suitable for real companies to use. Moreover, there're virtually no limits in further enhancements 
that can be added to a corporate gnosis setup, once this initial addition is made.

### Estimated time

The following are the basic features for implementing Corporate Gnosis:

* Roles and permissions
* Share management (+ [Research] EIPs for the creation and management of share assets)


### Team description

The 3 of us are team members at SelfKey, we're passionate about decentralized identity and initiatives
such as Gnosis. There's significant place for Gnosis technology in our own development, and we have 
many fascinating ideas to use (and enhance) Gnosis Safe for identity and corporate cases.

### Future ideas

We believe improving Gnosis governance is just a first step on top of which many other interesting
features can be built. We're definitely looking forward to explore the following possibilities:

* Gnosis wallet UI integration with Gnosis Corporate
* Automated billing/invoicing
* Integration with accounting software
* Safe storage and management of company documents & data
* Decentralized Corporate Identities: tools for DIDs and Verifiable Credentials on Gnosis
* KYC-based key recovery module

We're excited to discuss these (and any others!) with the Gnosis team. Feel free to contact us anytime.
