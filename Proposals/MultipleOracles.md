# Proposal Guideline 
## Project Overview

### Project name
Multiple oracles with the same choices.
### Team members 
Victor Porton
### What project are you building 
When there are many choices, it's inefficient to create several oracles with the same choices. Fix this.
### Why did you decide to build it 
I want to stimulate predictions markets development by creating prediction market of prediction markets (the next project for the same bounty). See my book [Social Crypto Libertarianism](https://leanpub.com/socialcrypto) for more details why I want it.
A big number of scientists receiving salary through blockchain need to be processed by several competing oracles.

### How long will it take 
A week.
### How much funding are you requesting  
As you funds projects of this complexity usually.
### How did you hear about the GECO
