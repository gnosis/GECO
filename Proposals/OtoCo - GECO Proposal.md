# **Project OtoCo**


## Let users who created an onchain LLC with [otoco.io](https://otoco.io) easily open a secure crypto assets wallet for their company and add multi-sig to it via a fully-integrated Gnosis Safe solution. 

## Once applied to transactions from the company’s crypoassets wallet, the solution could then be extended to users’ governance roles generally (e.g. Member, Manager, Administrator, Treasurer, etc) that require a multi-sig, including voting and signing of resolutions.

### **About the team: A collaboration between Doiim x Otonomos**

OtoCo is a collaborative project between Doiim and Otonomos.

**[Doiim](https://doiim.com/)** is a software studio specialized in blockchain, machine learning, and UX. 

Since 2009, Doiim has had the goal of developing a mobile app that provides personalized content curation to the ever-increasing number of people being overwhelmed by information overload. The app aggregates content from social media and news outlets to provide a personalized experience. 

In 2013 we created a trading bot that acts as a market maker and provides liquidity through arbitrage in crypto-currencies to Latin American countries.

Since January 2016 we've also started doing software and business development for fairlay.com.

In 2018, with the help of Certisign, the largest Certificate Authority in Brazil, we developed and deployed Ethereum's Ropsten a legally binding blockchain ID that's equivalent to written signatures.

Since 2020, we worked with **Otonomos** on the blockchain component of its OtoCo product, which combines technology and legal engineering to give legal validity to entities natively formed on blockchain. 

OtoCo is Otonomos’ onchain company formation assembler whilst Otonomos itself forms and manages companies for the crypto and blockchain community offchain in some of the world’s most prominent jurisdictions.  It counts some of the most visible blockchain projects and teams as its clients, including Ethereum and some of its principals and entities owned by members of the Gnosis team.

### **What project are you building?**

A decentralized crypto banking and governance application using Gnosis Safe multisig wallet for use by owners and managers of onchain companies and entities

The solution allows stakeholders to participate in the decision-making around how crypto assets are held and allocated in their decentralized organization, and links users’ signing privileges to the actual powers they derive from their legal roles in real-world entities such as Wyoming and Delaware LLCs.


### **Why did you decide to build it?**

The team has built an automated company assembler, OtoCo, to empower users to form and run their businesses on the Ethereum Blockchain. 

In essence, OtoCo allows a user’s Ethereum wallet to be the first Member of a real-world LLC and have smart contract-based signing rights, rather than using offchain, analog processes.

Once the LLC then goes beyond a Single Member Single Manager LLC, it requires a governance logic that enables multi-party decision making e.g. on how to manage the company’s resources (i.e. the crypto assets held in its wallets), how to conduct day-to-day operations, etc.

This governance logic has to be conducted from within a trustless dashboard accessible to all stakeholders, with their level of signing privilege a direct function of the role they have in the organization.

Such decentralized governance is of particular importance to anyone who manages a digital business with staff, partners and collaborators spread around the world, performing their tasks remotely. 

Such liquid democracy also allows ideas and initiatives to emerge from the collective and guarantees participation by all when making decisions and reaching consensus.


### **The current solution**

Currently, OtoCo’s multi-sig functionality is limited to the mere creation of the company’s crypto wallet, the addition of additional signatures and the setting of simple signing thresholds.

Once the wallet is created, users need to leave otoco.io and perform all actions, including changes in the number of signatures and signing logic, from within [https://gnosis-safe.io/](https://gnosis-safe.io/) .

Our request for a grant (see below) is to now (1) internalize these functions by making them accessible from within the OtoCo Dashpanel so users can find everything under one roof, and (2) broaden the multi-sig functionality to include corporate actions such as shareholder votes, proxies, and director resolutions.


### **How long will it take?**

2 months, consisting of 2 three-week sprints each with a one-week testing phase.


### **How much funding are you requesting?**

$50,000


### **How did you hear about the GECO?**

OtoCo was created by Han from Otonomos with the help of Doiim, both of whom have previously worked with Gnosis and provided services to Martin Koeppelman.  


### **Proposal**

The goal of our proposal is to implement an application that allows OtoCo users to democratically run the onchain companies they created using our tool. 

As seen above, with OtoCo users can already create a Gnosis-Safe multisig wallet to hold the crypto assets of their onchain entity. 

The next step is to extend this functionality in two dimensions:



1. Let users manage the multi-sig, including adding or changing the number of signature parties and the signing rules, all from within the OtoCo dashpanel.

    Once built, users will then be able to add other owners to multisig wallets, visualize crypto assets balances, manage off-chain approval requests, transfer tokens, and do transactions after deploying Gnosis Safe multisig wallets within the OtoCo dashboard. 

2. Link the multi-sig functionality to people’s actual legal roles in the organizations they are involved in, as Member/Shareholder and/or Manager/Director, or in any other role assigned to them within the specific governance logic of the entity.

By mapping users’ real world powers to signing privileges using private keys attached to specific roles, we believe governance of onchain organizations will gain a level of legitimization which may so far have been lacking.

If we get GECO funding, our application will be another step forward for the OtoCo community, and will benefit other use cases within the DAO Ecosystem and -  eventually - the mainstream community of doers and builders.
