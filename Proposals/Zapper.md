# Zapper.Fi Integration
_This is a proposal to add Zapper.Fi to the "APPS" Section._

## Project Overview

### Project name
> Zapper.Fi
### Team members 
> [Nodar](https://twitter.com/NodarJ), [Seb](https://twitter.com/sebaudet26), [Suhail](https://twitter.com/cryptonomik), [Apoorv](https://twitter.com/apoorvlathey).
### What project are you building 
> Manage all your DeFi assets from one simple interface.
### Why did you decide to build it 
> We started using Gnosis daily and a big missing piece for ourselves is the ability to add, stake and rebalance liquidity between different underlying DeFi protocols. [Learn more about pooling.](https://docs.zapper.fi/invest/pooling) 
> With incentives constantly shifting and underlying protocols typically requiring end-users to hop between multiple UIs, as a user I want to be able to utilizing pooling opportunities on Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve without leaving Gnosis.
### How long will it take 
> Up to 24 hours.
### How much funding are you requesting  
> $1000
