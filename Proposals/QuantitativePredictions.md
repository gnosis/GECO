## Project Overview

### Project name
Quantitative predictions in Gnosis
### Team members 
Victor Porton
### What project are you building 
Improve Gnosis Ethereum API to allow also predictions of numeric values in the diapason `0..1`.
### Why did you decide to build it 
I want to stimulate predictions markets development by creating prediction market of prediction markets (the next project for the same bounty). See my book [Social Crypto Libertarianism](https://leanpub.com/socialcrypto) for more details why I want it.
### How long will it take 
I expect I need just a few days.
### How much funding are you requesting  
"Medium complexity: $1,500 (3-10 days of work)" - [the GitCoin bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/gnosis/GECO/75/100023743)

## Your Proposal 
### Project description
Improve Gnosis Ethereum API to allow also predictions of numeric values in diapason `0..1` instead of just yes/no. (The paid sum if the collateral sum multiplied by this coefficient.) The sum is enforced to be less than or equal to `1` to avoid shortage of funds. The funder decides whether the sum of the numbers must be `1` or may be less than `1`.
I will decide whether to create a separate contract or amend the existing one at the Phase I.
I want to stimulate predictions markets development by creating prediction market of prediction markets (the next project in the same bounty). See my book [Social Crypto Libertarianism](https://leanpub.com/socialcrypto) for more details why I want it. Prediction market of prediction markets is expected to be decided by voting and the votes quantity (probably transformed by some formula like quadratic voting), so it is a number `0..1`. Thus we need this project. You should fund me because it is (see the book) a step to the next economical structure. Moreover, it is just an overall improvement in Gnosis.
