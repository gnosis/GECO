## Project Overview

### Safe-App Bitrefill

### Team members 
@nicosampler

### What project are you building 
Safe App integration for https://www.bitrefill.com/.

### Why did you decide to build it 
I have used Bitrefill before and it would be great to could use it directly with my Safe.

### How long will it take 
Between 9 and 12 days.

### Project description

I propose to develop a Safe-App to integrate with Bitrefill. I think it would be great to provide the users with an App not only to hold/invest tokens but to buy products and services in a simple and faster way. 
The App will contain a section to search by product and services. (filtered by country, category or text). Once the result is provided the user will be able to select one or more items and click a button to buy them, then the App will prompt an email and a new order will be generated. After that, the user will have to sign a TX with a value in ETH for the equivalent to the products/services he/she has picked and will receive an email with the voucher. 

To communicate with Bitrefill Iâ€™ll use the same API they are using on their website.


### Features
- IPFS deploy
- ENS Domain to provide simple access.
- React

### Team description
I'll work on this project alone. I have a lot of background as a Frontend developer and 1 year of experience working with Ethereum.

### Timeline, Milestones and Deliverables
I propose to deliver when the project is ended.
