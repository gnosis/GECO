### What project are you building

> LeptonMusic---- A Web3 Music NFT App. 
### Why did you decide to build it

> The music industry in China has an annual income of 395.096 billion CNY, but only a few goes to music content artists: in traditional centralized music platforms and copyright companies, 52% of musicians have no music income, and 24% of musicians’ music income accounts for less than 5% of personal total income. Music creation is with high cost but low income, and many musicians can only engage in business outside music to support music creation and career. The main reasons are as follows:
>
> (1) Opaque and weak copyright royalty protection
>
> (2) Listeners' low payment rate
>
> (3) Difficulties in publicizing independent copyright contents
>
> (4) Exploitation from centralized music platforms and copyright companies 
### How long will it take 
> 14 weeks
### How much funding are you requesting

> $3000

### How did you hear about the GECO

## Your Proposal 
### Project description

_LeptonMusic is China's first “Listen To Earn” interactive music NFT platform for convenient music copyright publication, unconditional copyright security, and maximum music income for the new generation of musicians. Lepton replaces the traditional copyright model with the Web 3.0 de-centralized model, and all royalty profits go to artists and listeners. The audience can listen to earn LeptonMusicCoin (LMC) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT). Based on Blockchain and Quantum Signature Technology, LeptonMusic creates a complete and vigorous system of music virtual assets and benefits the music industry from cryptocurrency and decentralized finance._
