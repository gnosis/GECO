### What project are you building

We are building a survey application that has 2 components:

1) **SurveyX**

A system that facilitates crowd opinion mining and incentivization for any survey that is made for any purpose. This not a prediction market use-case. But, it is a nice example of how some projects could be modeled and built with Gnosis Mercury packages as it is a prediction market use-case. 
 
 2) **NonRepudiationX**
 
 A BlockChain scalability solution that best fit for prediction markets and can leverage Gnosis Mercury and exposes it to more use-cases. In addition to increasing the speed and lowering the cost paid by the end users.


### Why did you decide to build it

We believe that a successful project has to touch the pain of a real business case.

***SurveyX:*** Incentivizing the crowd opinion is the main pain point of any survey maker. So, having a website that facilitates crowd mining and rewarding will solve a real business problem.


***NRX (NonRepudiationX) Scalability Solution:*** BlockChain till now did not reach mass-adoption. And two main reasons for that are the scalability (limited number of transactions per second) and cost (transaction cost is relatively high).


### How long will it take
The project is estimated to take 6 to 9 months. 

### How much funding are you requesting
56 000 USD.

### How did you hear about the GECO
[Gnosis](https://gnosis.pm/ "Gnosis") website


## Your Proposal

### Project Description

***SurveyX***

Crowd opinion mining and rewarding DApp.


***NRX (NonRepudiationX) Scalability Solution***

A BlockChain Off-Chain/On-Chain scalability solution as part of SurveyX.

### Features

***SurveyX***

The DApp POC is available at http://surveyx.io. You can find the source code, and helpful information in the readme file, at https://github.com/apper-tech/surveyx.

Actually, the POC (http://surveyx.io) is built with React, Truffle 5 & and solidity 0.5. However, after getting the grant from Gnosis we will re-implement it utilizing Gnosis Mercury packages; And we will keep it in React.


## SurveyX POC
- **Main Page**
    
    You will get this page after you launch the app. It is the landing page:

 - **Test-net Main-net Connectivity Check Page**
    
    You might get this page after you launch the app in case of a network misconnection

- **Survey Creation Page**
    
    A page to create a new survey, define the options, pay the fee and start enrolling participants
  
 
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VHkxBexFbs3CfBqUTZTAgNaZLxafi_mj">

 - **Survey Created**
   
    You will get this page after you create a survey

*Kindly pair in mind that the POC (Proof-of-Concept) is an incomplete version that is made only for the purpose of demonstration. And it will be recreated after getting the funds.*

We will consult and employ many full-time and part-time qualified professionals as needed. But the mentioned above are, the 12 months full-time, dedicated team members who will work hard and smart to turn the ideas to successful projects.


## Timeline, Milestones, and Deliverables
**Phase I:** 
Implementing Core Features
   - Deliverables
		- SurveyX beta version (includes survey builder).
		- Implement NonRepudiationX in SurveyX.
		- Document and encourage using NonRepudiationX for Prediction Markets built with Gnosis.
   - Time and Price Estimate: 2 to 3 months - 18 000 USD



**Phase II:**

Enhancements, Stabilization and Code Refactoring
- Deliverables
    - Heavy testing and bugs fixes.
    - Deploy to Ethereum main net.
    - Implement additional features like reports, a dashboard and etc...
    - Design and implement a business model.
 - Time and Price Estimate: 2 to 3 months - 18 000 USD

**Phase III:** 

Final Technical Touches, Community Building, and Business Model Fine-Tuning.
 
This phase is where we will look more for achievements from a business point of view.

How much effect we could make, is proof of a good technical solution in addition to smart work.

- Deliverables
	- Reach at least 1000 users on SurveyX.io
    - In addition to the above, ensure a successful achievement to at least 3 of the following numbers:
	    - 10 enhancements or feature-requests implementation for opened issues for SurveyX on GitHub.
	    - 1000 viewers for YouTube marketing and/or technical video(s).
	    - 1000 viewers for Medium article(s).
	    - One or more published research paper (most likely about NonRepudationX) in an academic journal or conference.
	    - 1 partnership (at least).
   - Time and Price Estimate: 2 to 3 months - 20 000 USD
   
### What is after those Phases
At the point when we will finish the intended work mentioned above, we will consider that we had fulfilled our commitment to Gnosis. But we will not stop. We will plan for financial stability in addition to new levels of expansion mainly through:
 - Ensuring a revenue stream that keeps the business running and expanding…
 - Continuously looking for more partnerships...
 - Raising fund and spending it to gain more market share…
