### What project are you building

We are building three components:

1)  **InvestorX**

A prediction market use-case that aims to provide the best financial advice for investors on Ethereum platform. 

2) **SurveyX**

A system that facilitates crowd opinion mining and incentivization for any survey that is made for any purpose. This not a prediction market use-case. But, it is a nice example of how some projects could be modeled and built with Gnosis Apollo packages as it is a prediction market use-case. 
 
 3) **NonRepudiationX**
 
 A BlockChain scalability solution that best fit for prediction markets and can leverage Gnosis Apollo and exposes it to more use-cases. In addition to increasing the speed and lowering the cost paid by the end users.


### Why did you decide to build it

We believe that successful projects have to touch the pain of a real business case.

***InvestorX:***
Almost all crypto community are investors who would appreciate good advice and could be engaged relatively easy in investment voting activities. There are already lots of Technical Analysts (on Telegram and specialized sites) with many followers and we will target them all.


***SurveyX:*** Incentivizing the crowd opinion is the main pain point of any survey maker. So, having a website that facilitates crowd mining and rewarding will solve a real business problem.


### How long will it take
The 3 projects are estimated to take 4 months for core functionality. 

However, because we believe in high-quality and because achieving the business goals will need extra time, we will spend an additional 4 months for things like enhancements, stabilization and code refactoring. And another 4 months for manly for community building and business model fine-tuning in parallel with adding the art-touches on the technical solutions.

### How much funding are you requesting
90 000 USD for working 12 months on the three components: _InvestorX_, _SurveyX_, and _NonRepudiationX (NRX) Scalability Solution_.

Actually, we can have the fund to only one selected item of the above (which is the Scalability Solution). However, we strongly recommend that funding them 3 together. Especially that, InvestorX is built with Angular, SurveyX is built with React and the NRX will expose them, and all other similar cases that can be built with Gnosis Apollo, to mass-adoption.

If you chose to fund only NonRepudiationX, we will need 65 000 USD. This does not mean that InvestorX and SurveyX are very less cheap to implement; But this is because it will be is easier to have a successful business model and/or gather funds to them, away from Gnosis, after their MVP is implemented. However, you may choose to fund NonRepudiationX in this round; And we will apply for InvestorX, SurveyX in the next funding round after 3 months.

## Your Proposal

### Project Description

***InvestorX***

An Ethereum decentralized application for crypto-investment with decentralized nomination and elections. The DApp aims to elect top investment wallet in term of ROI (return on investment) for a given period.


***SurveyX***

Crowd opinion mining and rewarding DApp.


### Features

***InvestorX***

As said, "A picture is worth a thousand words"  and a running prototype worth a thousand pictures. So, we made a POC that you can check at http://investorx.io. And the code is available here https://github.com/apper-tech/investorX and we encourage you to check the readme file as you can find some detailed information there.

Actually, the POC (http://investorx.io) is built with Angular, Truffle 5 & and solidity 0.5. However, after being funded by Gnosis, we will re-implement it utilizing Gnosis Apollo packages. But we will keep it in Angular.

***SurveyX***

This DApp POC is also available at http://surveyx.io. And you can find the source code, and helpful information in the readme file, at https://github.com/apper-tech/surveyx.

Actually, the POC (http://surveyx.io) is built with React, Truffle 5 & and solidity 0.5. However, after getting the grant from Gnosis we will re-implement it utilizing Gnosis Apollo packages; And we will keep it in React.

We will consult and employ many full-time and part-time qualified professionals as needed. But the mentioned above are, the 12 months full-time, dedicated team members who will work hard and smart to turn the ideas to successful projects.


## Timeline, Milestones, and Deliverables
**Phase I:** 
Implementing Core Features
   - Deliverables
		- Rebuild InvestorX and SurveyX with Gnosis Apollo
		- InvestorX beta version
        - SurveyX beta version
        - Create Truffle Boxes (https://truffleframework.com/boxes)
          - Truffle Box for InvestorX as a fully featured sample starting Angular project built with Gnosis Apollo.
          - Truffle Box for SurveyX as a fully featured sample starting React project built with Gnosis Apollo.
          - Creating Truffle boxes means clear and clean code that fit for the purpose, but also generalized for other cases.
        - Implement NonRepudiationX and use it with InvestorX and SurveyX.
   - Time and Price Estimate	4 months - 30 000 USD



**Phase II:**

Enhancements, Stabilization and Code Refactoring
- Deliverables
    - Perform heavy testing and bugs fixes for InvestorX and SurveyX.
    - Deploy InvestorX and SurveyX to Ethereum main net.
    - Integrate NRX with Gnosis Apollo packages (we will fork the repositories and make pull-requests for Gnosis repositories: pm-contracts, pm-js, pm-trading-db and pm-trading-ui).
    - Implement additional app-specific features like pages to view historical data, reports and a dashboard for InvestorX and SurveyX.
    - Design and implement a business model for InvestorX and SurveyX.

    - 20 enhancements or feature-requests implemented for opened issues at github.com
    - 2000 users on InvestorX.io and SurveyX.io together (this ensures a good business model in addition to a good technical solution).
    - 2000 viewers for 2 or more Medium articles on how to use Gnosis and Gnosis Apollo (starting from our Truffle Boxes).
    - 2000 viewers for YouTube marketing video(s) that we use to promote InvestorX and SurveyX.
