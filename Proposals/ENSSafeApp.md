- Display ENS names owned by your Safe
- Register .ETH name (by default should also set resolver to Public Resolver and ETH Address record to multisig’s receiving Ethereum address)
- Claim DNS name on ENS (by default should also set resolver to Public Resolver and ETH Address record to multisig’s receiving Ethereum address)
- Create subdomains of ENS names
- Transfer ENS name’s Registrant and Controller
- Set ENS name resolver (should default to most recent Public Resolver)
- Set ENS name records (Addresses, Content, Text Records)
- Renew/add registration years to .ETH names

### Project name

Gnosis Safe ENS App

### Team members

- @kamescg

### What project are you building

I'm developing the ENS Safe application so users of the Gnosis Safe can register, renew, manage and add sub-domains to the Ethereum Name System, using a Gnosis Multisig

https://github.com/kamescg/gnosis-safe-ens-app

### Why did you decide to build it

Broadly, I think it's an important application to have for the community. Most serious projects use a Gnosis Multsig to manage projects and having a way to easily add ENS name to a project infrastructure is a valuable.

Personally, I use ENS for my accounts and have several projects (comming) that require a multisig and having a simple way to manage domains would be nice.

And more specifically, I would like to earn the bounty.

### How long will it take

5-7 Days

### How much funding are you requesting

The proposed bounty as outlined in https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-gnosis-safe-ens-grant-95cd87845c57

"Gnosis Safe and ENS are teaming up to offer another Safe Apps grant of up to $6000, consisting of $3000 in DAI plus a matching $3000 in ETH."

### How did you hear about the GECO

Was directed towards GECO by a Gnosis Safe Staff Member (John)

## Your Proposal

### Project description

A complete integration with the Ethereum Name System.

I'm building this project, because I want the prestige (great resume item) of building a popular application for Gnsosis and ENS.

Gnosis should fund the proposal, because I will build a clean, easy-to-maintin application that will be completed quickly and on-time.

### Features

#### Primary Features

- Display ENS names owned by your Safe
- Register .ETH name (by default should also set resolver to Public Resolver and ETH Address record to multisig’s receiving Ethereum address)
- Claim DNS name on ENS (by default should also set resolver to Public Resolver and ETH Address record to multisig’s receiving Ethereum address)
- Create subdomains of ENS names
- Transfer ENS name’s Registrant and Controller
- Set ENS name resolver (should default to most recent Public Resolver)
- Set ENS name records (Addresses, Content, Text Records)
- Renew/add registration years to .ETH names

#### Design

- Logo/Branding
- Matching CSS
- Helpful Links

**A significant emphasis will be put on matching the current Ethereum Name System branding and style to ensure trust with user.** Matching the existing ENS APP CSS (copying/pasting if possible) and writing any custom styling (matching aesthetic) so the ENS Safe App feels like a native experience.

#### Libraries/Module

Will use the standard frontend libraries: ethers, web3-react (if neccesary) and @gnosis.pm/safe-apps-ethers-provider to manage communication with the network.

I plan on build the ENS Safe APp using the Gnosis Safe App Template, which has already been forked and edited.

### Team description

I'm a developer that's been in the space for 3+ years. Working at Consensys for 2 years and now working as a consultant for individual projects.

Recently won the ETHGlobal hachakthon - https://medium.com/aave/marketmake-aave-winners-298869221907

Project name StableYield (https://github.com/stableyield/hackathon)

### Timeline, Milestones and Deliverables

I expect the project to be completed in a single milestone in roughly 5-7 days (perhaps sooner)

I've setup the basic application structure and now simply need to finish wiring everything up.

### Others

Decentralize the world.
