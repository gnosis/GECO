## Your Proposal 
### Project description
1. UI for setting up and reconfiguring (using [this PR](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/pull/243)) Social Recovery module
2. UI for social recovery by another Gnosis Safe

Writing a phone app is outside of the scope of this proposal.

I want to do this stuff because:

* I am a Gnosis Safe user and want to use modules myself.
* I am a creating the [https://github.com/gnosis/safe-modules/pull/23](`Bequest` module) that I also use in my other project, and I want to be able to make its UI, too, so this series of proposals.

The goal is to make modules well supported in UI.

You should fund me because social recovery is important and thus we need an UI for this module.
### Features
I provide a PR for https://github.com/gnosis/safe-react and possible related repositories as appropriate.

I use React.

I will implement it as a Safe app.

### Others	 
I apply accordingly [README.md](https://github.com/gnosis/GECO/blob/master/README.md) not accordingly [Project%20Ideas/Safe%20Apps%20Grants.md](https://github.com/gnosis/GECO/blob/master/Project%20Ideas/Safe%20Apps%20Grants.md), because despite formally it is an app proposal, this proposal contradicts to the spirit (as specified by "example use-cases") of [Project%20Ideas/Safe%20Apps%20Grants.md](https://github.com/gnosis/GECO/blob/master/Project%20Ideas/Safe%20Apps%20Grants.md) because my project isn't an integration with a non-Gnosis project as most apps are.

I apply for several GECO grants at once, so I it is assumed that I do not do them simultaneously.

I do not warrant beautiful UI (it can be made more beautiful later), however I do implement a quality UX.
It is assumed that high beauty of the UI is not a criterion for the payout for this grant.
